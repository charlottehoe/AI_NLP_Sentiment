# AI_NLP_Sentiment

Welcome to my NLP Sentiment Analysis project.

First, verify that the NLTK library is installed. Otherwise, run :
pip install --user -U nltk

For more info, please refer to https://www.nltk.org/install.html.

After that, you can run the code. A small widget will appear in which you have to write a sentence. The result of the sentiment analysis will appear in the widget.
